# Bandit configuration for CrewAI Email Triage
# All skipped tests are justified in SUBPROCESS_SECURITY.md
#
# B404 - subprocess import: Safe, controlled usage with hardcoded args
# B603 - subprocess without shell: Safe, we explicitly avoid shell=True  
# B607 - partial executable path: Safe, using known system executables
# B110/B112 - try/except pass/continue: Intentional error handling patterns
# B311 - random for jitter: Not cryptographic, just retry timing variation
