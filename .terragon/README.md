# ü§ñ Terragon Autonomous SDLC System

## Overview

The Terragon Autonomous SDLC system provides continuous value discovery and execution for software development projects. It automatically identifies, prioritizes, and executes the highest-value work items using advanced scoring algorithms.

## üéØ Value Discovery Engine

### Scoring Methodology

The system uses a hybrid scoring approach combining three methodologies:

1. **WSJF (Weighted Shortest Job First)**
   - Cost of Delay = Business Value + Time Criticality + Risk Reduction
   - WSJF Score = Cost of Delay / Job Size (effort estimate)

2. **ICE (Impact, Confidence, Ease)**
   - Impact: Business value of the work (1-10)
   - Confidence: Certainty of successful execution (1-10)
   - Ease: How easy it is to implement (1-10)
   - ICE Score = Impact √ó Confidence √ó Ease

3. **Technical Debt Scoring**
   - Debt Impact: Maintenance cost reduction
   - Debt Interest: Future cost if not addressed
   - Hotspot Multiplier: Based on code churn and complexity

### Composite Score Calculation

```
Composite Score = (
  weights.wsjf * normalize(WSJF) +
  weights.ice * normalize(ICE) +
  weights.technicalDebt * normalize(TechDebt) +
  weights.security * SecurityBoost
) * CategoryMultipliers
```

## üîç Discovery Sources

The system automatically discovers work items from:

- **Code Comments**: TODO, FIXME, HACK, XXX, DEPRECATED markers
- **Static Analysis**: Ruff, MyPy, Bandit findings
- **Security Analysis**: Vulnerability scans and dependency audits
- **Performance Analysis**: Benchmark opportunities and optimization potential
- **Git History**: Commit patterns indicating technical debt
- **Issue Trackers**: Open issues and enhancement requests

## üöÄ Usage

### Manual Discovery

```bash
# Run value discovery
python3 .terragon/value-discovery.py

# Run autonomous execution
python3 .terragon/autonomous-executor.py
```

### Automated Scheduling

```bash
# Set up cron scheduling
.terragon/schedule-discovery.sh

# Add the generated cron entries to your crontab
crontab -e
# Then add contents from .terragon/cron-entries.txt
```

### Scheduled Operations

- **Hourly**: Lightweight value discovery scan
- **Daily**: Comprehensive analysis with autonomous execution  
- **Weekly**: Strategic review and scoring model recalibration

## üìä Repository Assessment

This repository has been assessed as **ADVANCED** maturity (85%+) with:

### ‚úÖ Existing Capabilities
- Comprehensive testing infrastructure (8,502+ LOC of tests)
- Advanced monitoring and observability stack
- Security hardening and compliance frameworks
- Operational excellence with blue-green deployment
- Performance optimization and chaos engineering
- Documentation with ADRs and operational runbooks

### üéØ Value Discovery Results

Current backlog includes:
- **Technical Debt**: Code comment analysis and cleanup
- **Bug Fixes**: TODO comment resolution
- **Performance**: Benchmark analysis and optimization
- **Security**: Dependency vulnerability management

## üìà Metrics and Tracking

### Value Metrics
- **Composite Scores**: Hybrid WSJF + ICE + Technical Debt scoring
- **Execution Velocity**: Completed items per time period
- **Value Delivered**: Estimated business impact of completed work
- **Technical Debt Reduction**: Quantified debt paydown

### Execution Tracking
- **Success Rate**: Percentage of successfully executed items
- **Cycle Time**: Average time from discovery to completion
- **Quality Metrics**: Test pass rates and quality check results
- **Rollback Rate**: Percentage of changes requiring rollback

## üîß Configuration

Configuration is managed in `.terragon/config.yaml`:

```yaml
scoring:
  weights:
    advanced:  # Repository maturity level
      wsjf: 0.5
      ice: 0.1
      technicalDebt: 0.3
      security: 0.1
  thresholds:
    minScore: 10
    securityBoost: 2.0

execution:
  maxConcurrentTasks: 1
  testRequirements:
    minCoverage: 80
```

## üìù Files Structure

```

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety Features

### Execution Safety
- **Comprehensive Testing**: All changes validated with full test suite
- **Quality Gates**: Code quality checks must pass before commitment
- **Automatic Rollback**: Failed executions automatically rolled back
- **Branch Isolation**: All work done on feature branches

### Human Oversight
- **Security Reviews**: Security-related changes flagged for manual review
- **Pull Request Creation**: High-risk changes create PRs instead of direct commits
- **Execution Limits**: Configurable limits on autonomous execution frequency

## üîÑ Continuous Learning

The system continuously improves through:

- **Execution Feedback**: Actual vs. predicted effort and impact tracking
- **Scoring Model Updates**: Automatic adjustment based on execution outcomes
- **Pattern Recognition**: Learning from similar work items
- **Velocity Optimization**: Improving estimation accuracy over time

## üé≠ Repository-Specific Optimizations
