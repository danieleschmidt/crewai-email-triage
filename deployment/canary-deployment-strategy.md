# Canary Deployment Strategy for Email Triage Service

## Overview
Advanced canary deployment pattern optimized for AI-powered email processing workloads with real-time traffic splitting and automated rollback mechanisms.

## Deployment Stages

### Stage 1: Infrastructure Validation (0% traffic)
- Health check validation
- Dependency connectivity tests
- Configuration verification
- Performance baseline establishment

### Stage 2: Canary Release (5% traffic)
```yaml
canary_config:
  initial_traffic_percentage: 5
  duration_minutes: 15
  success_criteria:
    error_rate_threshold: 0.1%
    latency_p99_threshold_ms: 500
    memory_usage_threshold_mb: 300
```

### Stage 3: Progressive Rollout
- 5% → 25% → 50% → 100%
- 15-minute intervals with automated validation
- Real-time SLI monitoring and alerting

## Automated Rollback Triggers
- Error rate > 0.5% sustained for 2 minutes
- P99 latency > 1000ms for 3 consecutive measurements
- Memory usage > 80% of allocated resources
- AI model accuracy drop > 5% from baseline

## Traffic Routing Strategy
```yaml
routing_rules:
  - match:
      headers:
        x-canary-user: "true"
    route:
      destination: canary-service
  - match:
      weight: 5  # 5% traffic to canary
    route:
      destination: canary-service
  - route:
      destination: stable-service
```

## Monitoring & Observability
- Real-time email processing metrics comparison
- A/B testing for classification accuracy
- User experience impact assessment
- Cost-per-email processing analysis

## Rollback Procedure
1. Immediate traffic redirect to stable version
2. Preserve canary logs for analysis
3. Generate automated incident report
4. Schedule post-mortem within 24 hours
