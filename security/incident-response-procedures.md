## Response Procedures

### Phase 1: Initial Response (0-15 minutes)

#### 1. Incident Identification
```bash
# Immediate Actions Checklist:
□ Verify the incident is legitimate (not false positive)
□ Classify severity level (P0-P3)
□ Identify affected systems and data
□ Document initial findings
□ Notify incident response team
```

#### 2. Communication Protocol
```bash
# Critical Incidents (P0/P1):
1. Page on-call security team immediately
2. Notify incident commander within 5 minutes
3. Establish war room/incident channel
4. Send initial status update to stakeholders

# Medium/Low Incidents (P2/P3):
1. Log incident in ticketing system
2. Assign to appropriate team member
3. Set up monitoring for escalation
```

#### 3. Initial Containment
```bash
# Automated Containment (where possible):
- Isolate affected systems from network
- Disable compromised user accounts
- Block malicious IP addresses
- Activate backup systems if needed

# Manual Containment Steps:
1. Preserve evidence (take snapshots, logs)
2. Implement immediate protective measures
3. Document all containment actions
4. Prepare for detailed investigation
```

### Phase 2: Investigation and Analysis (15 minutes - 4 hours)

#### 1. Evidence Collection
```bash
# System Forensics
sudo dd if=/dev/sda of=/forensics/system-image-$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).img
sudo cp -r /var/log/ /forensics/logs-$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)/
sudo netstat -tulpn > /forensics/network-$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).txt

# Application Logs
kubectl logs -n production --all-containers=true > /forensics/k8s-logs-$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).txt
docker logs $(docker ps -q) > /forensics/docker-logs-$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).txt

# Database Activity
# Export relevant database audit logs
# Check for unauthorized data access patterns
```

#### 2. Impact Assessment
```yaml
Assessment Areas:
  Data Impact:
    - Types of data potentially compromised
    - Volume of affected records
    - Sensitivity classification of data
    - Compliance implications (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.)
  
  System Impact:
    - Affected systems and services
    - Business process disruption
    - Customer service impact
    - Financial implications
  
  Security Impact:
    - Compromised credentials or systems
    - Potential for lateral movement
    - Data integrity concerns
    - Reputation damage risk
```

#### 3. Root Cause Analysis
```bash
# Timeline Reconstruction
1. Create detailed timeline of events
2. Map attacker movement through systems
3. Identify initial compromise vector
4. Document security control failures
5. Assess vulnerability exploitation methods

# Analysis Tools
- Log correlation across multiple systems
- Network traffic analysis
- File integrity monitoring results
- User behavior analytics
```

### Phase 3: Containment and Eradication (1-8 hours)

#### 1. Complete Containment
