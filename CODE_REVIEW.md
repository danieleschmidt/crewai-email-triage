# Code Review

## Engineer Review
- ✅ `ruff check .` found no issues.
- ✅ `bandit -r src -q` reported no security problems.
- ✅ `python -m compileall -q src tests` completed with no errors.
- ✅ `pytest -q` ran 10 tests successfully.

## Product Review
- The sprint board lists four completed tasks: base agent interface, classifier, summarizer, and response agents.
- Acceptance criteria in `tests/sprint_acceptance_criteria.json` specify success and invalid-input cases for each agent. All corresponding tests pass.
- Implementation matches the plan in `DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md` for multi-agent email processing.
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` is absent, so architectural guidance is missing.

## Summary
The feature branch delivers simple agent classes that satisfy the defined acceptance criteria. Code quality and security checks pass, and tests confirm expected behavior for normal and edge cases. Future work should provide architectural documentation and expand functionality beyond these minimal agents.
