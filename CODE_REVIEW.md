# Code Review

## Engineer Review
- ✅ `ruff check .` found no issues.
- ✅ `bandit -r src -q` reported no security problems.
- ✅ `python -m compileall -q src tests` completed with no errors.
- ✅ `pytest -q` ran 26 tests successfully.

## Product Review
- The sprint board lists seven completed tasks: base agent interface, classifier, priority, summarizer, response agents, the triage workflow, and a CLI script.
- Bulk processing is now supported for lists of emails.
- Acceptance criteria in `tests/sprint_acceptance_criteria.json` specify success and invalid-input cases for each agent. All corresponding tests pass.
- Implementation matches the plan in `DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md` for multi-agent email processing.
 - `ARCHITECTURE.md` documents the simple agent pipeline and provides basic architectural guidance.

## Summary
The pipeline now includes a CLI script that accepts optional keyword overrides for the PriorityAgent, supports JSON output, and provides a helper to triage multiple emails at once.
The feature branch delivers simple agent classes that satisfy the defined acceptance criteria. Code quality and security checks pass, and tests confirm expected behavior for normal and edge cases. A brief architecture overview has been added and a triage workflow ties the agents together, but future work should expand functionality beyond these minimal agents.
