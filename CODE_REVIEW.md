# Code Review

## Engineer Review
- ✅ `ruff check .` returned no issues.
- ✅ `bandit -r src` found no security issues.
- ❌ Tests initially failed because package was not installed; after `pip install -e .`, tests passed.
- No nested loops or obvious performance smells were found in the codebase.

## Product Review
- Acceptance criteria from `tests/sprint_acceptance_criteria.json` require a success case and null input edge case.
- The tests in `tests/test_foundational.py` cover both cases and pass after installing the package.
- The README mentions an architecture diagram, but there is no `ARCHITECTURE.md` file in the repo, so architectural documentation is missing.

## Summary
The implementation meets the sprint acceptance criteria and passes code quality checks. The commit message could be more descriptive, and architectural documentation is absent.
