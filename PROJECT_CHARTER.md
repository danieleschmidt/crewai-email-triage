# Project Charter: CrewAI Email Triage

## Executive Summary

CrewAI Email Triage is an intelligent multi-agent email processing system designed to automatically classify, prioritize, summarize, and draft responses for email messages. This project addresses the critical business need for efficient email management in high-volume communication environments.

## Project Vision

To create a robust, scalable, and secure email triage system that reduces manual email processing overhead by 80% while maintaining accuracy and professional communication standards.

## Problem Statement

Modern professionals and organizations face email overload, with the average knowledge worker spending 2.6 hours daily managing email. Current email clients provide basic filtering but lack intelligent processing capabilities for:

- Automatic classification and prioritization
- Context-aware summarization
- Draft response generation
- Batch processing capabilities
- Integration with existing workflows

## Project Objectives

### Primary Objectives
1. **Automated Email Classification**: Achieve 95% accuracy in categorizing emails (urgent, spam, work, personal)
2. **Intelligent Prioritization**: Implement dynamic priority scoring based on content, sender, and keywords
3. **Summarization Engine**: Generate concise, accurate summaries maintaining key information
4. **Response Generation**: Draft contextually appropriate replies reducing response time by 60%
5. **Batch Processing**: Handle 100+ emails per minute with parallel processing capabilities

### Secondary Objectives
1. **Security Compliance**: Implement enterprise-grade security for credential handling
2. **Provider Integration**: Support Gmail, IMAP, and extensible provider architecture
3. **Developer Experience**: Maintain comprehensive test coverage (>80%) and documentation
4. **Performance Optimization**: Sub-second processing for individual emails
5. **Monitoring & Observability**: Full telemetry and health monitoring

## Scope Definition
