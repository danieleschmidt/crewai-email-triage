# ADR-0002: Multi-agent pipeline architecture

**Date**: 2025-07-27
**Status**: Accepted
**Deciders**: Development Team

## Context

We need to design an architecture for processing emails that can classify, prioritize, summarize, and generate responses. The system should be modular, testable, and extensible.

## Decision Drivers

* Need for clear separation of concerns
* Requirement for modularity and testability
* Extensibility for future agents
* Performance requirements for batch processing
* Maintainability and code clarity

## Considered Options

* Monolithic email processor
* Multi-agent pipeline with sequential processing
* Event-driven microservices architecture
* Functional composition approach

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Multi-agent pipeline with sequential processing", because it provides clear separation of concerns while maintaining simplicity and avoiding the complexity of distributed systems.

### Positive Consequences

* Clear separation of responsibilities
* Easy to test individual agents
* Simple to understand and maintain
* Straightforward to add new agents
* Good performance for expected workloads

### Negative Consequences

* Sequential processing may limit parallelization
* Tight coupling between pipeline stages
* Single point of failure if one agent fails

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Multi-agent pipeline with sequential processing

* Good, because each agent has a single responsibility
* Good, because agents can be developed and tested independently
* Good, because the pipeline is easy to understand
* Bad, because processing is inherently sequential

### Monolithic email processor

* Good, because it's simple to implement initially
* Bad, because it violates separation of concerns
* Bad, because it's difficult to test individual components
* Bad, because it's hard to extend with new features

### Event-driven microservices architecture

* Good, because it allows for independent scaling
* Good, because it enables parallel processing
* Bad, because it adds significant complexity
* Bad, because it requires additional infrastructure
