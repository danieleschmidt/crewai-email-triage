# ADR-0001: Record architecture decisions

**Date**: 2025-07-27
**Status**: Accepted
**Deciders**: Development Team

## Context

We need to record the architectural decisions made on this project to ensure that future developers understand the reasoning behind design choices and can make informed decisions about changes.

## Decision Drivers

* Need for transparency in architectural decisions
* Knowledge preservation for team members
* Historical context for future changes
* Standardized documentation format

## Considered Options

* No formal documentation of decisions
* Wiki-based documentation
* Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
* Inline code comments only

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)", because they provide a lightweight, structured format for documenting decisions that becomes part of the codebase and version control history.

### Positive Consequences

* Decisions are documented alongside the code
* Version controlled with the project
* Standardized format for consistency
* Easy to reference and link between decisions

### Negative Consequences

* Additional overhead for documenting decisions
* Need to maintain discipline to keep records updated

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

* Good, because they are lightweight and structured
* Good, because they become part of the codebase
* Good, because they provide historical context
* Bad, because they require discipline to maintain

### Wiki-based documentation

* Good, because they are easy to edit
* Bad, because they can become outdated
* Bad, because they are separate from the codebase

### No formal documentation

* Good, because there is no overhead
* Bad, because decisions are lost over time
* Bad, because new team members lack context
